# Eats and Beats

## Description 
Eats and Beats App wants to bring an unique experience to the user, by combining two of our team members passions: music & food. Our desire is to bring a easy and intuitive digital tool, to help the user experience and share a great moment.  
  
I built this app with four other awesome team members in my first group project during the Norhtwestern Coding Bootcamp.  I made some updates on my own time to finnesse our work which are reflected in this repo.  You can view the original project [here](https://github.com/Team-Norm-1/project-1).

## User Story
AS A: Food and music enthusiast   
I WANT: to easily discover new recipes to try and music to enjoy  
SO THAT: I can explore new music and develop better cooking skills

## User Experience
WHEN I search for a recipe  
THEN I am presented with a recipe that matches my criteria  
WHEN I view my recipe behind displayed  
THEN I am presented with the name of the recipe, the ingredients, the time, and the instructions  
WHEN I view the playlist generate  
THEN I can listen the a playlist tied to the recipe-type  
WHEN I research a new recipe  
THEN I populate a new recipe and playlist  
WHEN I click on the button try again  
THEN I am again presented with a new recipe and playlist who match my criteria
